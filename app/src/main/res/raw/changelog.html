        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16">Well, I was pretty much busy with life and work, but that’s not an excuse, I know!. TBH with you all, I started working on FastHub v5 beginning of last year and I did actually made a good progress but then crisis landed on me when my mom diagnostic with cancer and that really stroke me hard and demotivated me to even care about my own health, it took awhile for me to recover and start accepting this fact and i’m still trying to figure out way to motivate myself more to progress on FastHub or anything in the Open Source Community.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18"><strong>TL;DR:</strong> this is just a bug fix version and I will continue to fix bugs until V5 is ready for shipment.</p>
